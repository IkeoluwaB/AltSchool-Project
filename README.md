# AltSchool-Project
This showcases the first-semester project for AltSchool Africa Data Engineering class of 2023 project.
This project builds an expense database 

There are two classes: Expense and ExpenseDatabase
```
class Expense:
    def __init__(self,id, title ,amount):
```` 
```
class ExpenseDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
````

The Expense class represents an expense item, which has the following attributes:

```
class Expense:
    def __init__(self,id, title ,amount):
        self.id = (str(uuid.uuid4()))
        self.title = title
        self.amount = amount
        self.created_at = datetime.utcnow()
        self.upated_at= datetime.utcnow()
```
id: a unique identifier for the expense, generated by the uuid module
title: a string that describes the expense
amount: a numeric value that indicates the cost of the expense
created_at:  DateTime object that indicates when the expense was created
updated_at:  DateTime object that indicates when the expense was last updated

The Expense class also has the following methods:

update: a method that updates the title and/or amount of the expense, if they are not None. It also sets the updated_at attribute to the current time using the datetime module.
```
 def update(self, title = None, amount = None):
        if title is not None:
            self.title = title
        if amount is not None:
            self.amount = amount
        self.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()
```

to_dict: a method that returns a dictionary representation of the expense, with the attribute names as keys and the attribute values as values.

```
def to_dict(self):
        return{
            "id":self.id,
            "title": self.title,
            "amount":self.amount,
            "created_at": self.created_at,
            "updated_at": self.upated_at
        }
```

The ExpenseDatabase class represents a collection of expenses, which has the following attribute:

```
def __init__(self):
        self.database = []
```

database: a list that stores the expenses as objects of the Expense class. The database is assigned to an empty list 


The ExpenseDatabase class also has the following methods:
add_expense: a method that takes an expense object as an argument and appends it to the database list. It also returns a string that confirms the addition of the expense.

```
 def add_expense(self, expense):
        self.database.append(expense)

````

remove_expense: a method that takes an id as an argument and removes the expense object with that id from the database list. It also prints a message that confirms the removal of the expense.


```
def remove_expense(self,id):
    self.database = [expense for expense in self.database if expense.id != id]
        print(f"Expense with id{id} has been removed!")
```


get_expense_by_id: a method that takes an id as an argument and returns a list of expense objects with that id from the database list. If there is no such expense, it returns an empty list.

```
def get_expense_by_id(self, id):
        return[expense for expense in self.database if expense.id == id]
```


get_expense_by_title: a method that takes a title as an argument and returns a list of expense objects with that title from the database list. If there is no such expense, it returns an empty list.


```
def get_expense_by_title(self, title):
        return[expense for expense in self.database if expense.title == title]

```


to_dict: a method that returns a list of dictionaries, each representing an expense object in the database list, using the to_dict method of the Expense class.


```
def to_dict(self):
        return[expense.to_dict() for expense in self.database]
```
